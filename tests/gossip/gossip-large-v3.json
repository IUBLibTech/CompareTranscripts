Jack was well in the lead now. He drove 12 blocks out of his way to drop Janice off first. Then he took his time getting Jean back to the grocery store. Jean introduced Jack to her mother and father, and presto, he'd won. He had a date with Jean for Friday night. From the time Jack called for her and all during the afternoon and evening, Jean kept thinking to herself how lucky she was that her father had moved his store here so she could attend Marion. She was a brand new student and already she'd won the art contest, made a whole circle of friends, had been asked to pledge the girls' club, and now here she was out with the most popular boy in school. But when they drove home, Jean began to learn a little more about Jack. His popularity had gone to his head. He was completely sure of himself, confident that none of the girls could resist him. Jean's slap didn't hurt his face, but it certainly injured his pride. He tried to laugh it off, but he was thinking that he'd have to get even. Jack didn't lose any time. He was giving the other boys a highly-colored version of the date. To regain his self-confidence and build himself up in their eyes, he added a few details. Remarks about Jean, completely untrue. But then, gossip seldom worry about the truth. Now the gossip began to spread. Bill Ellis colored it a little more and passed it on. Then Christine Manners took over. First, she used her lunch hour to tell the story to every girl who would listen, and that included practically every girl in the school. When she got home, she took over the telephone to call all those she'd missed. Yes, gossip spreads like wildfire, especially with the help of girls like Christine. And by the end of the day, the harm was done. Jean's reputation was ruined. The next morning, Christine still wasn't through. She'd been jealous of the new girl's popularity and talent from the state. She wanted to start. Now was her chance. But the picture gave Jean her first inkling that something was wrong. She knew it had been torn down deliberately. She asked her friend Janice if she'd done something wrong. But Janice was too uncomfortable, embarrassed to tell Jean to her face. Everyone took pains to ignore her. She felt like an outcast, yet couldn't imagine why. Jean was hurt and bewildered. Marion High had seemed so wonderful only last week. It was like a completely different school. Gossip. Jean was lonely and miserable all week, but she was still hopeful that once she was initiated into the girls' club, things would be better. However, Jean had already been blackballed, even before the club's scavenger hunt had started. But instead of telling her, the club president had made Jean's assignments far more difficult than the other girls', hoping Jean would fail, thus disqualifying herself. Not knowing this, Jean started out on the scavenger hunt as eagerly as any of the others. She was willing to work twice as hard as the other pledges to be initiated. The rest of the pledges had finished their assignments and had been notified of their acceptance before Jean returned. Now the girls were really embarrassed. Jean came back with every one of her assignments completed. What could she do next? The last thing Christine told her, she'd been blackballed. She wasn't wanted. Jean couldn't understand. She'd done her assignments as well as any of them. Why had she been rejected? Christine said Jean knew very well. Why? Because they didn't want her kind of girl in their club. Jean still didn't understand. Janice finally had to explain that they all knew about her, about Jack's story. Jean was stunned. How could anybody believe that? It was her. When Mr. and Mrs. Gage came home, Jean told them what had happened. That she hadn't been accepted by the club because of the gossip about her. She said she was quitting school. She said she wanted to go back to school. She said she wanted to go back to school. So that's the story she told me. That's why the Gages came to see me. They agreed with Jean. It would be better if she left school. But I asked them to wait. Give me a chance to do what I could. Gossip is difficult to fight. You have to go right to the source and stamp it out. That's exactly what I did. I called in Jack Monroe. Asked him point blank. If he was the gossip. Jack was surprised. He thought only women gossip. Men just, well, never realized the harm it would do. When I had finished explaining what his loose talk had done to Jean, Jack asked me what he could do. And I told him away. The only way. He thought it over. It wasn't going to be easy. It would be embarrassing and we both knew it. But he finally agreed. Give Jack credit. He went through it. His voice broke a few times. But he managed to tell them all that there was nothing to the gossip. That he had made up the story and was to blame for everything. But that wasn't quite right. I told them that anyone who listens to gossip is almost as much to blame as the person who spreads it. We were going to discuss the problem in assembly. Make the whole school aware of the danger. And make sure that no Marion student would ever again be hurt the way Jean was. The next day the whole student body realized what they had done to Jean. Now they wanted to make it up to her. She made a fresh start and was soon one of Marion's most popular girls. One of our real leaders. What could have been another gossip tragedy had been a happy ending. But don't forget this. There needn't have been so much as a near tragedy of our students instead of imitating this bird. The gossipy parrot had instead copied three far wiser creatures. The three little monkeys who see no evil, hear no evil, and speak no evil. They all But I've got you covered.

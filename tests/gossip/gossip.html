                            <li>Pretty clever bird, the parrot. He can actually talk, pronounce words. Of course, he has no idea what the words mean, so we never take him seriously. Unfortunately, that's not true with gossips. They use words just as carelessly as the parrot, but sometimes we take them seriously, and often innocent persons are harmed.</li>
                            
                            <li>see, gossips don't stop to think that words are dangerous. They influence our national life, and in war they are powerful weapons. Gossips toss words around as carelessly as parrots, with no more sense of the harm they can do. Did I hear somebody say gossiping is monopolized by women? Far from it. Anyone who uses words carelessly, especially to talk behind someone's back, is a gossip. Let me tell you a little story about a gossip. This is Marian High, my school. I'm the principal, George Eastmoor. There were some people in my office this particular morning, Mr. And Mrs. Gage and their daughter, Jean. They told me Jean would have to leave school. Why? Because of the malicious gossip about her. I was shocked, and I asked</li>
                            
                            <li>details to see if we could do something about it. We began talking, even though Jean thought it was already too late. Mr. And Mrs. Gage had opened a grocery store at the start of the term, and Jean helped out after school. Usually, it's difficult for a boy or girl entering a new school to get acquainted and make friends. But in Jean's case, it was easy. She's a very good artist. Her first drawing won a school award, and the prize-winning picture was posted on the bulletin board. That seemed to open the doors for her. All the girls were interested and anxious to meet her. The first friend she made was Janice Nelson. Course, Marian High is co-educational, and the other half of our student body is always interested in a pretty, popular new girl.

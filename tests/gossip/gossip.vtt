GEORGE EASTMOOR: Pretty
clever bird, the parrot.

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.390 align:middle line:84%
He can actually talk,
pronounce words.

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.640 align:middle line:84%
Of course, he has no
idea what the words mean,

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.290 align:middle line:90%
so we never take him seriously.

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.080 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, that's
not true with gossips.

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.750 align:middle line:84%
They use words just as
carelessly as the parrot,

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.030 align:middle line:84%
but sometimes we
take them seriously,

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.340 align:middle line:84%
and often innocent
persons are harmed.

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.430 align:middle line:84%
You see, gossips don't stop to
think that words are dangerous.

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.050 align:middle line:84%
They influence
our national life,

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:15.560 align:middle line:84%
and in war they are
powerful weapons.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.510 align:middle line:84%
Gossips toss words around
as carelessly as parrots,

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:20.870 align:middle line:84%
with no more sense of
the harm they can do.

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:22.490 align:middle line:84%
Did I hear somebody
say gossiping

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.260 align:middle line:90%
is monopolized by women?

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:25.200 align:middle line:90%
Far from it.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.330 align:middle line:84%
Anyone who uses
words carelessly,

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.410 align:middle line:84%
especially to talk behind
someone's back, is a gossip.

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:34.660 align:middle line:84%
Let me tell you a little
story about a gossip.

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.160 align:middle line:90%
This is Marian High, my school.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.190 align:middle line:84%
I'm the principal,
George Eastmoor.

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.840 align:middle line:84%
There were some people in my
office this particular morning,

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.480 align:middle line:84%
Mr. And Mrs. Gage and
their daughter, Jean.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.120 align:middle line:84%
They told me Jean would
have to leave school.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.650 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:49.970 align:middle line:84%
Because of the malicious
gossip about her.

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:51.910 align:middle line:84%
I was shocked, and
I asked for details

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:53.900 align:middle line:84%
to see if we could do
something about it.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.110 align:middle line:84%
We began talking, even
though Jean thought

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.780 align:middle line:90%
it was already too late.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.300 align:middle line:84%
Mr. And Mrs. Gage had
opened a grocery store

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.460 align:middle line:84%
at the start of the term, and
Jean helped out after school.

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.456 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:06.456 --> 00:02:10.449 align:middle line:90%


00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:12.970 align:middle line:84%
Usually, it's difficult
for a boy or girl entering

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.670 align:middle line:84%
a new school to get
acquainted and make friends.

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.720 align:middle line:90%
But in Jean's case, it was easy.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.130 align:middle line:90%
She's a very good artist.

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.285 align:middle line:84%
Her first drawing
won a school award,

00:02:21.285 --> 00:02:22.660 align:middle line:84%
and the prize-winning
picture was

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.100 align:middle line:90%
posted on the bulletin board.

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.770 align:middle line:84%
That seemed to open
the doors for her.

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.470 align:middle line:84%
All the girls were interested
and anxious to meet her.

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.900 align:middle line:84%
The first friend she
made was Janice Nelson.

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.890 align:middle line:84%
Course, Marian High
is co-educational,

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.540 align:middle line:84%
and the other half
of our student body

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.620 align:middle line:84%
is always interested in a
pretty, popular new girl.

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.300 align:middle line:84%
So, while Jean's new
friend Janice Nelson

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.460 align:middle line:84%
was introducing her to
some of the other girls,

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.780 align:middle line:84%
Jack Monroe and Bill Ellis,
our two ranking casanovas,

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.700 align:middle line:84%
were making a little
bet as to which would

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.491 align:middle line:90%
make the first date with her.

Bill Ellis made the first move.

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.160 align:middle line:84%
He was waiting on the steps
when Janice and Jean left school

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.710 align:middle line:84%
that afternoon, and soon
was off to a running

Jack wasn't called the
best broken field runner

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:16.490 align:middle line:90%
in Marian history for nothing.

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:21.100 align:middle line:84%
Besides, he still had
some trumps in his hand.

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.040 align:middle line:84%
Like an open convertible, which
had helped quite a few times

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.980 align:middle line:90%

Bill didn't know
it yet, but he was

about to be outmaneuvered
by an old trick--

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:37.625 align:middle line:90%
the fake flat tire.

Then he took his time getting
Jean back to the grocery store.

Jean introduced Jack to
her mother and father,

and presto, he'd won.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.740 align:middle line:84%

Jean for Friday night.

From the time jack
called for her and all

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:12.380 align:middle line:84%
during the afternoon
and evening,

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.140 align:middle line:84%
Jean kept thinking
to herself how lucky

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:16.630 align:middle line:84%
she was that her father
had moved his store here

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.320 align:middle line:90%
so she could attend Marian.

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.350 align:middle line:84%
She was a brand new
student and already she'd

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.030 align:middle line:84%
won the art contest, made
a whole circle of friends,

pledge the girls club.

But when they drove
home, Jean began

to learn a little
more about Jack.

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:41.700 align:middle line:84%
His popularity had
gone to his head.

sure of himself,

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.070 align:middle line:84%
confident that none of the
girls could resist him.

Jean's slap didn't
hurt his face,

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:54.590 align:middle line:84%
but it certainly
injured his pride.

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:56.680 align:middle line:84%
He tried to laugh it
off, but he was thinking

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.330 align:middle line:90%
that he'd have to get even.

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.480 align:middle line:84%
Jack didn't lose any time giving
the other boys a highly colored

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:02.740 align:middle line:90%
version of the date.

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.080 align:middle line:84%
To regain his self-confidence
and build himself up

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.500 align:middle line:84%
in their eyes, he added a few
details, remarks about Jean

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:09.890 align:middle line:90%
completely untrue.

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:13.690 align:middle line:84%
But then gossip seldom
worry about the truth.

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:15.770 align:middle line:90%
Now, the gossip began to spread.

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:18.560 align:middle line:84%
Bill Ellis colored it a
little more and passed it on.

Then Christine

First, she used her lunch
hour to tell the story

to call all those she'd missed.

with the help of
girls like Christine.

And by the end of the
day, the harm was done,

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.385 align:middle line:90%
Jean's reputation was ruined.

00:05:49.385 --> 00:05:52.590 align:middle line:90%

The next morning, Christine
still wasn't through.

Now was her chance.

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:02.700 align:middle line:84%
But the picture gave
Jean her first inkling

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:03.970 align:middle line:90%
that something was wrong.

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:06.870 align:middle line:84%
She knew it had been
torn down deliberately.

She asked her friend Janice
if she'd done something wrong,

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:11.620 align:middle line:84%
but Janice was
too uncomfortable,

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:15.180 align:middle line:84%
embarrassed to tell
Jean to her face.

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:17.390 align:middle line:84%
Everyone took pains
to ignore her.

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:21.600 align:middle line:84%
She felt like an outcast,
yet couldn't imagine why.

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.700 align:middle line:90%
Jean was hurt and bewildered.

Marian High had seemed so
wonderful only last week.

different school--

Jean was lonely and
miserable all week,

but she was still
hopeful that once she

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:37.320 align:middle line:84%
was initiated into the girls
club, things would be better.

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:39.450 align:middle line:84%
However, Jean had
already been blackballed

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:41.940 align:middle line:84%
even before the club's
scavenger hunt had started.

But instead of telling
her, the club president

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:46.140 align:middle line:84%
had made Jean's assignments
far more difficult

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:48.460 align:middle line:84%
than the other girls,
hoping Jean would fail,

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:50.330 align:middle line:90%

The rest of the pledges had
finished their assignments

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:18.940 align:middle line:84%
and had been notified of their
acceptance before Jean returned.

really embarrassed.

Jean came back with every one
of her assignments completed.

What could she do next?

Nothing, Christine told
her, she'd been blackballed.

She'd done her assignments
as well as any of them.

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:39.050 align:middle line:90%
Why had she been rejected?

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:41.800 align:middle line:84%
Christine said Jean
knew very well why.

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:44.800 align:middle line:84%
Because they didn't want her
kind of girl in their club.

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:46.910 align:middle line:90%
Jean still didn't understand.

00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:49.800 align:middle line:84%
Janice finally had to
explain that they all knew

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:52.120 align:middle line:90%
about her, about Jack's story.

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:53.580 align:middle line:90%
Jean was stunned.

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:56.510 align:middle line:84%
How could anybody
believe that about her?

00:07:56.510 --> 00:08:03.664 align:middle line:90%

00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:15.110 align:middle line:84%
When Mr. And Mrs.
Gage came home,

00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:16.670 align:middle line:84%
Jean told them
what had happened,

00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:18.880 align:middle line:84%
that she hadn't been
accepted by the club because

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:20.240 align:middle line:90%
of the gossip about her.

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:21.840 align:middle line:84%
She said she was
quitting school.

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:25.300 align:middle line:90%


00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:27.640 align:middle line:90%
So that's the story she told me.

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:29.300 align:middle line:84%
That's why the Gages
came to see me.

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:30.350 align:middle line:90%
They agreed with Jean.

00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:32.059 align:middle line:84%
It would be better
if she left school.

00:08:32.059 --> 00:08:35.620 align:middle line:84%
But I asked them to wait, give
me a chance to do what I could.

00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:37.490 align:middle line:90%
Gossip is difficult to fight.

00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:39.974 align:middle line:84%
You have to go right to the
source and stamp it out.

00:08:39.974 --> 00:08:47.610 align:middle line:90%


00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:49.350 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly what I did.

00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:52.170 align:middle line:84%
I called in Jack Monroe,
asked him point blank

00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:53.380 align:middle line:90%
if he was the gossip.

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:54.670 align:middle line:90%
Jack was surprised.

00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:56.050 align:middle line:90%
He thought only women gossip.

00:08:56.050 --> 00:08:59.440 align:middle line:84%
Men just, well-- realize
the harm it would do.

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:02.190 align:middle line:84%
When I had finished explaining
what his loose talk had done

00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:04.690 align:middle line:84%
to Jean, Jack asked
me what he could do,

00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:06.720 align:middle line:84%
and I told him a
way, the only way.

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:07.970 align:middle line:90%
He thought it over.

00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:09.280 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't going to be easy.

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:11.380 align:middle line:84%
It would be embarrassing,
and we both knew it,

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:12.710 align:middle line:90%
but he finally agreed.

00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:18.230 align:middle line:90%


00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:19.350 align:middle line:90%
Give Jack credit.

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:20.500 align:middle line:90%
He went through with it.

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:22.400 align:middle line:84%
His voice broke a
few times, but he

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:25.290 align:middle line:84%
managed to tell them all that
there was nothing to the gossip,

00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:28.440 align:middle line:84%
that he had made up the story,
and was to blame for everything.

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:30.290 align:middle line:90%
But that wasn't quite right.

00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:32.810 align:middle line:84%
I told them that anyone
who listens to gossip

00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:35.820 align:middle line:84%
is almost as much to blame
as the person who spreads it.

00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:38.330 align:middle line:84%
We were going to discuss
the problem in assembly,

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:40.740 align:middle line:84%
make the whole school
aware of the danger,

00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:43.910 align:middle line:84%
and make sure that no Marian
student would ever again be

00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:46.070 align:middle line:90%
hurt the way Jean was.

00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:47.840 align:middle line:84%
The next day, the
whole student body

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:49.710 align:middle line:84%
realized what they
had done to Jean.

00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:51.580 align:middle line:84%
Now they wanted to
make it up to her.

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:53.450 align:middle line:84%
She made a fresh
start, and was soon one

00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:56.760 align:middle line:84%
of Marian's most popular
girls, one of our real leaders.

00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:58.670 align:middle line:84%
What could have been
another gossip tragedy

00:09:58.670 --> 00:10:00.020 align:middle line:90%
had been a happy ending.

00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:02.000 align:middle line:84%
But don't forget
this, there needn't

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.860 align:middle line:84%
have been so much
as a near tragedy

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:05.780 align:middle line:84%
if our students,
instead of imitating

00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:09.800 align:middle line:84%
this bird, the gossipy
parrot, had instead

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:12.560 align:middle line:84%
copied three far wiser
creatures, the three

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:17.300 align:middle line:84%
little monkeys, who see no evil,
hear no evil, and speak no evil.
